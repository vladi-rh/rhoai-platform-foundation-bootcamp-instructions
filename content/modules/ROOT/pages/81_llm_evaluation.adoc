# Evaluating Large Lanuage Models 

In this section we will cover how Large Language Models can be evaluated using LM-Eval framework.

[WARNING]
====
This lab only works with rhoai-eus-2.16-aws-gpu overlay on Demo cluster.
Qwen_Instruct model used in the lab requires gpu node and trustyai ConfigMap patching instructions are not applicable for RHOAI 2.18 due to the way how operator now controls that ConfigMap
====

Validate via ArgoCD that all components are deployed and synced. TrustyAI demo components are deployed via `ai-example-lmeval-lab` application. It includes LLM model from https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct[]. Source code can be found under 'tenants/ai-example/lmeval-lab'. Minio deployment for object storage is done via 'ai-example-lmeval-lab-minio' ArgoCd application - source code is under 'tenants/ai-example/lmeval-lab-minio'.

'Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct' model requires Nvidia GPU - so it might take some time for GPU machine to be provisioned and model to start. You can monitor the process in OpenShift Console under `Compute -> Machines`. Model is deployed in `ai-example-lmeval-lab` namespace. Make sure that `qwen-instruct-predictor*` pod is up and running.

By default trustyai component is configured to prevent online access. In order for LLM Evaluation to succeed - online access needs to be enabled. Run the following commands to allow online connections:

[SOURCE]
----
oc patch configmap trustyai-service-operator-config -n redhat-ods-applications \
--type merge -p '{"data":{"lmes-allow-online":"true","lmes-allow-code-execution":"true"}}'

oc rollout restart deployment trustyai-service-operator-controller-manager -n redhat-ods-applications
----

Wait for couple minutes before proceeding or check the status of trustyai-service-operator-controller-manager pod in redhat-ods-applications namespace

LLM Evaluation can be initiated by creating the `LMEvalJob` Custom Resource.

.lm-eval-job.yaml

----

Copy the content of the yaml to a local file on your machine and apply it using the following command 

[SOURCE]
----
oc apply -f lm-eval-job.yaml
----

LM-Eval job will take some time to complete. The progress can be observed by monitoring `evaljob` pod in `ai-example-lmeval-lab` namespace.

Pod logs can be observed by running the following command:

[SOURCE]
----
oc logs -f pod/evaljob -n ai-example-lmeval-lab
----

If 'evaljob' pod fails - make sure that `trustyai-service-operator-config` configmap in redhat-ods-application namespace has `lmes-allow-online` set to `true`. If not - apply patch command above and restart `trustyai-service-operator-controller-manager` deployment.

LLM Evaluation job can be restarted by using ommands below.
 
[SOURCE]
----
oc delete LMEvalJob/evaljob -n ai-example-lmeval-lab

oc apply -f lm-eval-job.yaml
----

Once LM-Eval job completes - the evaluation results can be retrieved by running the following command:

[SOURCE]
----
oc get lmevaljobs.trustyai.opendatahub.io evaljob -n ai-example-lmeval-lab \
  -o template --template={{.status.results}} | jq '.results'
{
  "arc_easy": {
    "alias": "arc_easy",
    "acc,none": 0.6561447811447811,
    "acc_stderr,none": 0.009746660584852454,
    "acc_norm,none": 0.5925925925925926,
    "acc_norm_stderr,none": 0.010082326627832872
  }
}
----

Results show accuracy scores of 0.6561447811447811 and 0.5925925925925926 with stderr of 0.009746660584852454 and 0.010082326627832872
